30597733,Proteasuria-The impact of active urinary proteases on sodium retention in nephrotic syndrome.,"Sodium retention and extracellular volume expansion are typical features of patients with nephrotic syndrome. In recent years, from in vitro data, endoluminal activation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) by aberrantly filtered serine proteases has been proposed as an underlying mechanism. Recently, this concept was supported in vivo in nephrotic mice that were protected from proteolytic ENaC activation and sodium retention by the use of aprotinin for the pharmacological inhibition of urinary serine protease activity. These and other findings from studies in both rodents and humans highlight the impact of active proteases in the urine, or proteasuria, on ENaC-mediated sodium retention and edema formation in nephrotic syndrome. Targeting proteasuria could become a therapeutic approach to treat patients with nephrotic syndrome. However, pathophysiologically relevant proteases remain to be identified. In this review, we introduce the concept of proteasuria to explain tubular sodium avidity and conclude that proteasuria can be considered as a key mechanism of sodium retention in patients with nephrotic syndrome."

Early medical conditions and/or somatic symptoms such as abdominal pain may lead some with ARFID to experience somatic sensations as aversive. As such, food avoidance may be part of a broader behavioral repertoire aimed at suppressing bodily sensations. Avoiding these necessary and informative signals (e.g., growls of hunger) may subvert the emergence of healthy self-awareness and self-regulation. Teaching children with ARFID to engage adaptively with bodily sensations may help decrease aversiveness, increase self-awareness, and increase approach behaviors."

We aimed to identify patient and physician characteristics associated with APT management in thrombocytopaenic patients with haematological malignancy. A clinical vignette-based experiment was designed. Eleven haematologists were interviewed, identifying five variable categories. Next, 18 hypothetical vignettes were generated. Each physician received three vignettes and chose to: hold all APT; continue APT without platelet transfusion support; or continue APT with platelet transfusion support. The survey was distributed to haematologists and thrombosis specialists in three countries. Multivariate cluster robust Poisson regression models were used to calculate relative risks (RRs) of using one management option (over the other) for each variable in comparison to a reference variable. A total of 145 physicians answered 434 cases. Clinicians were more likely to hold APT in case of 20,000/µL platelets (vs. 40,000/µL; RR for continuing: 0.82 [95% confidence interval: 0.75-0.91]), recent major gastrointestinal bleeding (vs. none; RR 0.81 [0.72-0.92]) and when the physician worked at a university-affiliated community hospital (vs. non-academic community hospital; RR 0.84 [0.72-0.98]). Clinicians were more likely to continue APT in ST elevation myocardial infarction with dual APT (vs. unstable angina with single APT; RR 1.31 [1.18-1.45]) and when there were institutional protocols guiding management (vs. none; RR 1.15 [1.03-1.27]). When APT was continued, increased platelet transfusion targets were used in 34%. In summary, the decision process is complex and affected by multiple patient and physician characteristics. Platelet transfusions were frequently chosen to support APT, although no evidence supports this practice."

The purpose of this study was to investigate an age estimation method based on the volume ratio of the internal structure of the crown. 61 maxillary first premolars and 50 maxillary second premolars from subjects aged 20-79 years old were used. Micro CT, which can be used to analyze teeth in a non-destructive manner with high sensitivity, was employed in the present study. In consideration of individual differences among subjects, the volume ratio was calculated for the following four items: The pulp chamber was calculated separately based on the presence of enamel.In order to estimate age, regression analysis was conducted with the actual age as the dependent variable and each volume ratio as the independent variable. As a result, the highest correlation was found with PVR (E<sup>-</sup>) for each measurement item. Therefore, the regression equation using the volume change of the maxillary premolar crown as an index was as follows: Age = -12.43 × 4: PVR (E<sup>-</sup>) + 69.85. Age = -12.94 × 5: PVR (E<sup>-</sup>) + 72.54."

We designed a tetra-primer binding the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of 76 samples of Anisakis species and obtained reproducible results. ARMS revealed 380 bp and 130 bp ITS fragments in A. pegreffii, 380 bp and 280 bp fragments in A. simplex, a 130 bp fragments in A. typica and 380 bp, 280 bp and 130 bp fragments in an A. simplex - A. pegreffii hybrid.

30597218,Extracorporeal shock wave-assisted adipose-derived fresh stromal vascular fraction restores the blood flow of critical limb ischemia in rat.,"We tested the hypothesis that extracorporeal-shock-wave (ECSW)-assisted adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) therapy was better than either one for restoring the blood flow in critical limb ischemia (CLI). Adult male-SD rats were categorized into group 1 (sham-operated-control), group 2 (CLI), group 3 [CLI + ECSW (280 impulses/0.10 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>) applied to left inguinal area at 3 h after CLI], group 4 [CLI + SVF (1.2 × 10<sup>6</sup>) implanted into CLI area at 3 h after CLI], group 5 (CLI + ECSW-SVF). In vitro studies showed that ECSW significantly enhanced angiogenesis in human umbilical-vein endothelial cells and carotid-artery ring, and SVF significantly suppressed inflammation (TNF-α/NF-Κb/IL-1ß/MMP-9) in smooth-muscle cells treated by LPS (all p < .001). By day 14 after CLI, the ratio of ischemic/normal blood flow (INBF) was highest in group 1, lowest in group 2, significantly higher in group 5 than in groups 3 and 4, but no difference was shown between the latter two groups (all p < .001). The fibrotic area in CLI region exhibited an opposite pattern of INBF ratio (all p < .0001). Protein (CD31/vWF/eNOS) and cellular (CD31/vWF) expressions and number of small vessels in CLI area exhibited an identical pattern, whilst protein expressions of apoptotic (caspase3/PARP/mitochondrial-Bax) fibrotic/DNA-damaged (Samd3/TFG-ß/γ-H2AX) biomarkers exhibited an opposite pattern to INBF among five groups (all p < .0001). The numbers of angiogenetic cells in CLI region (SDF-1α/VEGF/CXCR4) and endothelial-progenitor cells (C-kit/CD31+//Sca-1/CD31+//CD34/KDR+/VE-cadherin/CD34+) in circulation significantly and progressively increased from groups 2 to 5 (all p < .0001). In conclusion, ECSW-SVF therapy effectively enhanced angiogenesis and restoration of blood flow in CLI area."

30596900,The overall metastatic rate in early esophageal adenocarcinoma: long-time follow-up of surgically treated patients.,"The overall metastatic potential of surgically treated early esophageal adenocarcinoma has not been studied in detail. This paper therefore assessed lymph node metastases at surgery, loco regional and distant metastases, in order to assess the metastatic potential of early esophageal adenocarcinoma. Two hundred and seventeen patients (53 T1a, 164 T1b; median follow-ups 87 and 75 months, 187 males) diagnosed with early esophageal adenocarcinoma and treated with esophagectomy in our tertiary center's database between July 2000 and December 2015 were included. All metastatic events were retrospectively analyzed, their topographic distribution was assessed, and the overall metastatic rate was calculated. Lymph node metastases occurred in 39 patients (18%) and 29 (13.4%) developed recurrences. Lymph node metastases were absent in m1 and m2 tumors and rare in m3 (1/18), m4 (5/21), and sm1 (4/42), but more frequent in sm2 (11/44) and sm3 tumors (18/78). Locoregional recurrences were exceedingly rare in m3 (2/18), m4 (1/21), sm1 (1/42), and sm2 (2/44), but frequent in sm3 (12/78). In contrast, distant metastases were more frequent with 2/18 in m3, 1/21 in m4, 4/42 in sm1, 4/44 in sm2, and 13/78 in sm3. Overall metastatic rates of 11.9% in sm1 (submucosal layer divided into equal thirds), 27.3% in sm2, and 32.1% in sm3 tumors were calculated. This first report of the metastatic potential of early esophageal adenocarcinoma provides a meticulous assessment of the overall metastatic risk. Metastatic events pose a relevant risk in surgically treated patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma with distant metastases being more frequent than locoregional recurrences."

30596803,Validation of the Clinical Index of Stable Febrile Neutropenia (CISNE) model in febrile neutropenia patients visiting the emergency department. Can it guide emergency physicians to a reasonable decision on outpatient vs. inpatient treatment?,"Advances in oncology have enabled physicians to treat low-risk febrile neutropenia (FN) in outpatient settings. This study was aimed to explore the usefulness of the CISNE model and identify better triage in the emergency setting. This is a retrospective cohort study on 400 adult FN patients presenting to the Emergency Department of National Cancer Center, Korea from January 2010 to December 2016. All had been treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for solid tumors in the previous 30 days. The primary outcome was the frequency of any serious complications during the duration of illness. Apparently stable patients numbered 299 (74.8%) of 400, and the remainder comprised clinically unstable patients. The stable patients fell into three cohorts according to the risk scores: CISNE I (low risk), 56 patients (18.7%); CISNE II (intermediate), 124 (41.5%) and CISNE III (high), 119 (39.8%). The primary outcome occurred in 10.7%, 19.4% and 33.6%, respectively, according to the cohort. Compared with the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer Risk Index Score (MASCC RIS), CISNE I stratum had significantly lower sensitivity (0.22 vs. 0.95 of MASCC low risk) but higher specificity (0.91 vs. 0.17) to predict zero occurrence of the primary outcome. The CISNE model was useful for identifying low-risk FN patients for outpatient treatment. The combination of the CISNE and MASCC RIS may help emergency physicians cope with FN more confidently."
30596757,Francisella induced microparticulate caspase-1/gasdermin-D activation is regulated by NLRP3 independent of Pyrin.,"Although the study of pathogen sensing by host defense systems continues to uncover a role for inflammasome components specific to particular pathogens, gaps remain in our knowledge. After internalization, Francisella escapes from the phagosome in mononuclear cells and is thought to be detected by intracellular pathogen-response-receptors pyrin and Aim2 in human and murine models, respectively. However, it remains controversial as to the role of pyrin in detecting Francisella. Our current work aims to study the contribution of inflammasome sensor, Pyrin in regulating microparticulate caspase-1/GSDM-D activation by Francisella. Our findings suggest that NLRP3 is central to the activation/release of active caspase-1/GSDM-D encapsulated in microparticles (MP) by Francisella. We also provide evidence that this regulation is independent of pyrin, implicated in sensing cytosolic Francisella in NLRP3-/- conditions where endogenous Pyrin is present. Absence of NLRP3 completely abrogated Francisella mediated MP caspase-1/GSDM-D activation and release both before and after internalization of the pathogen. However, deletion of pyrin not only enhanced both LPS and Francisella mediated MP active caspase-1/GSDM-D release, but pyrin overexpression resulted in a reduction of inflammasome activation and release; suggesting an inhibitory role of pyrin in LPS and Francisella mediated MP responses. This NLRP3 dependence and inhibitory effect of pyrin correlated with cytokine release as well. These observations also correlated with MPs ability to induce cell death; as LPS and Francisella-induced MPs from pyrin-deficient cells were more potent than wild-type monocytes whereas, NLRP3-/- MPs failed to induce cell death. Taken together, we report that NLPR3 not only mediates Francisella induced cytokine responses, but is also critical for cytokine-independent microparticle-induced inflammasome activation and endothelial cell injury independent of pyrin."
30596753,Anti-carbamylated protein antibodies and skin involvement in patients with systemic sclerosis: An intriguing association.,"Carbamylation is a post-translational modification that mostly affects proteins with low turnover, such as dermal proteins. Carbamylated proteins accumulate in skin in an age-dependent manner, contributing to tissue alterations. As dermis is affected by systemic sclerosis (SSc) and anti-carbamylated protein antibodies (anti-CarP Ab) are found in SSc patients, we sought to evaluate the specificity of anti-CarP Ab and their relationship with clinical parameters reflecting skin involvement in SSc. This study investigated serum samples and clinical data from 124 patients with SSc. Anti-CarP Ab were affinity purified from pooled SSc sera, and their specificity was assessed by western blotting and ELISA with carbamylated proteins from two species (human and bovine albumin; human fibrinogen). Anti-CarP Ab were measured in SSc serum samples and in 41 healthy aged-matched individuals. Affinity-purified anti-CarP Ab recognized carbamylated epitopes irrespective of the protein type or species origin. Anti-CarP Ab levels inversely correlated with the modified Rodnan skin score (mRss) (Spearman's R = -0.32, p<0.001), independently of patients' age. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis identified anti-CarP Ab cut-offs that best discriminated dichotomized clinical variables related to skin involvement: the only clinical variables that were significantly different between groups were mRss (p = 0.001) and scleredema (p<0.001). Low anti-CarP Ab levels were associated with worse skin involvement. Future prospective studies are needed to assess their usefulness in the clinical setting."
30596716,Better treatment outcomes in patients with actively treated therapy-related myeloid neoplasms harboring a normal karyotype.,"We analyzed treatment outcomes and prognostic factors in adult patients with therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MNs) to select patients who would be benefited by active anticancer treatment. After excluding 18 patients who received palliative care only and 13 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia, 72 t-MN patients (45 with acute myeloid leukemia and 27 with myelodysplastic syndrome) were retrospectively evaluated. Among them, 10 (13.9%), 32 (44.4%), and 30 patients (41.7%) had favorable, intermediate- and adverse-risk cytogenetics, respectively. Among patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics, patients with a normal karyotype (NK; N = 20) showed superior allogeneic stem cell transplantation-censored overall survival (AC-OS) and OS compared to those with non-NK-intermediate-risk cytogenetics (P < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, male sex, age ≥ 70 years, and unfavorable cytogenetics (non-NK-intermediate plus adverse risk cytogenetics) were associated with inferior AC-OS. Those results suggest that a more-refined subdivision of risk stratification would be necessary in patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics."
30596704,Trends in South Korean antimicrobial use and association with changes in Escherichia coli resistance rates: 12-year ecological study using a nationwide surveillance and antimicrobial prescription database.,"The purpose of this study is to determine the correlation between use of antimicrobials, such as fluoroquinolone, cefoxitin, and cefotaxime, and Escherichia coli resistance using a nationwide database. Nationwide data on antimicrobial consumption for 12 years (2002 to 2013) were acquired from a database of subjects (n = 1,025,340) included in the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort. National antimicrobial resistance rates of E. coli were obtained from the Korean Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System, which has been administered by the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 2002. Fluoroquinolone-resistance rates of E. coli isolated from general hospitals have continuously increased since 2002 and were correlated with nationwide fluoroquinolone use (r = 0.82, P = 0.0012) or ciprofloxacin use (r = 0.90, P<0.0001). Cefotaxime-resistance rates of E. coli isolated from general hospitals markedly increased since 2008 and were correlated with nationwide cefotaxime use (r = 0.94, P<0.0001) or third-generation cephalosporin use (r = 0.96, P<0.0001). Cefoxitin-resistance rates of E. coli isolated from general hospitals peaked in 2010 and significantly correlated with cephamycin use at a two-year interval (r = 0.64, P = 0.0256). In conclusion, consumption of antimicrobials such as fluoroquinolone, cefoxitin, and cefotaxime is well correlated with the resistance rates of E. coli to these agents. This study provides background data for national antimicrobial management policies to reduce antimicrobial resistance."

30596665,The immunological function of extracellular vesicles in hepatitis B virus-infected hepatocytes.,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) generates large amounts of complete and incomplete viral particles. Except for the virion, which acts as infectious particles, the function of those particles remains elusive. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been revealed to have biological functions. The EVs which size are less than 100 nm in diameter, were collected from HBV infected-patients. These vesicles contain, complete and incomplete virions, and exosomes, which have been recently shown to be critical as intercellular communicators. Here, the effects of the exosome, the complete, and the incomplete particles on the target cells were investigated. These particles are endocytosed by monocyte/macrophages and function primarily to upregulate PD-L1. The functions and composition of the EVs were affected by nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), suggesting that the EVs are involved in the pathogenesis of HBV hepatitis and clinical course of those patients treated by NRTIs."
30596643,"Anti-CD137 monoclonal antibody enhances trastuzumab-induced, natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity against pancreatic cancer cell lines with low human epidermal growth factor-like receptor 2 expression.","Because human epidermal growth factor-like receptor (HER) 2 is expressed on the surface of human pancreatic carcinoma cells to varying degrees, trastuzumab, an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (mAb), is expected to exert antibody-dependent, natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against the cells. However, some reports found that the effect of trastuzumab against human pancreatic carcinoma cells was limited because most express only limited HER2. We examined whether anti-CD137 stimulating mAb could enhance trastuzumab-mediated ADCC against Panc-1, a human pancreatic cancer cell line with low HER2 expression, in vitro. Supplementation of anti-CD137 mAb could improve trastuzumab-mediated ADCC against Panc-1 which was insufficient without this stimulating antibody. The ADCC differed in individual cells, and this was related to the expression of CD137 on the surface of NK cells after trastuzumab stimulation in association with the Fcγ-RIIIA polymorphism. NK cells with Fcγ-RIIIA-VV/VF showed high levels of ADCC against Panc-1, but those with Fcγ-RIIIA-FF did not show optimal ADCC. In addition, trastuzumab-mediated ADCC against the human pancreatic cancer cell line Capan-1 with high HER2 expression was generally high and not affected by the Fcγ-RIIIA polymorphism. These results demonstrated that in Fcγ-RIIIA-VV/VF-carrying healthy individuals, trastuzumab plus αCD137 mAb could induce effective ADCC against HER2-low-expressing pancreatic cancer cell lines, and that such an approach may result in similar findings in patients with pancreatic cancer."
30596639,Statistical investigations of protein residue direct couplings.,"Protein Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA), which predicts residue-residue contacts based on covarying positions within a multiple sequence alignment, has been remarkably effective. This suggests that there is more to learn from sequence correlations than is generally assumed, and calls for deeper investigations into DCA and perhaps into other types of correlations. Here we describe an approach that enables such investigations by measuring, as an estimated p-value, the statistical significance of the association between residue-residue covariance and structural interactions, either internal or homodimeric. Its application to thirty protein superfamilies confirms that direct coupling (DC) scores correlate with 3D pairwise contacts with very high significance. This method also permits quantitative assessment of the relative performance of alternative DCA methods, and of the degree to which they detect direct versus indirect couplings. We illustrate its use to assess, for a given protein, the biological relevance of alternative conformational states, to investigate the possible mechanistic implications of differences between these states, and to characterize subtle aspects of direct couplings. Our analysis indicates that direct pairwise correlations may be largely distinct from correlated patterns associated with functional specialization, and that the joint analysis of both types of correlations can yield greater power.

30596535,"Quercetin, a Plant Polyphenol, Has Potential for the Prevention of Bone Destruction in Rheumatoid Arthritis.","We investigated the immune-regulatory function of quercetin, in interleukin (IL)-17-produced osteoclastogenesis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA fibroblasts-like synoviocytes (RA-FLS) were stimulated with IL-17, and the mRNA expression and secretion of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes (osteoclast precursors) were stimulated with IL-17, RANKL, with/without quercetin, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity was evaluated to assess osteoclast differentiation. Osteoclast differentiation was investigated after coculturing IL-17-stimulated RA-FLS and Th17 cells with monocytes. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were cocultured with quercetin under Th17-inducing conditions, and their differentiation to Th17 cells and Treg cells was determined by flow cytometry analysis. We found that IL-17 stimulated RA-FLS to produce RANKL and quercetin decreased the IL-17-induced RANKL protein levels. Quercetin decreased the IL-17-produced activation of mammalian target of rapamycin, extracellular signal-regulated kinase and inhibitor of kappa B-alpha. When monocytes were stimulated with IL-17, macrophage colony-stimulating factor or RANKL, mature osteoclasts were formed, and quercetin decreased this osteoclastogenesis. When monocytes were cultured with IL-17-prestimulated RA-FLS or Th17 cells, osteoclasts were produced, and quercetin decreased this osteoclast differentiation. In Th17-differentiation conditions, quercetin suppressed Th17 cell and the production of IL-17, but quercetin did not affect Treg cells. Quercetin inhibits IL-17-stimulated RANKL production in RA-FLS and IL-17-stimulated osteoclast formation. Quercetin reduces Th17 differentiation. Quercetin could be an additional therapeutic option for bone destructive processes in RA."

30596443,The intersection of interpersonal violence and housing instability: Perspectives from women veterans.,"Women veterans in the United States face a disproportionate risk of housing instability (HI) and interpersonal violence (IV), largely perpetrated by intimate partners or involving nonpartner sexual violence, compared to both male veterans and nonveteran women. To explore the ways in which IV and HI intersect in the experiences of women veterans, we analyzed transcripts of in-depth qualitative interviews with 20 women veterans who had screened positive for HI at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Three broad themes emerged related to the intersection of IV (specifically intimate partner violence or nonpartner sexual violence) and HI among women veterans: (1) HI can be precipitated by and increase vulnerability to IV, (2) experiences of IV impact women's definitions of housing safety and security, and (3) IV can pose a barrier to accessing housing services and other support systems. Findings indicate areas for improvement to screening processes and service provision to more effectively address the co-occurring and interacting safety and housing needs of women veterans.

30596310,Improving Care of STEMI in the United States 2008 to 2012.,"Background We aimed to determine the change in treatment strategies and times to treatment over the first 5 years of the Mission: Lifeline program. Methods and Results We assessed pre- and in-hospital care and outcomes from 2008 to 2012 for patients with ST -segment-elevation myocardial infarction at US hospitals, using data from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Registry-Get With The Guidelines Registry. In-hospital adjusted mortality was calculated including and excluding cardiac arrest as a reason for primary percutaneous coronary intervention delay. A total of 147 466 patients from 485 hospitals were analyzed. There was a decrease in the proportion of eligible patients not treated with reperfusion (6.2% versus 3.3%) and treated with fibrinolytic therapy (13.4% versus 7.0%). Median time from symptom onset to first medical contact was unchanged (≈50 minutes). Use of prehospital ECGs increased (45% versus 71%). All major reperfusion times improved: median first medical contact-to-device for emergency medical systems transport to percutaneous coronary intervention-capable hospitals (93 to 84 minutes), first door-to-device for transfers for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (130 to 112 minutes), and door-in-door-out at non-percutaneous coronary intervention-capable hospitals (76 to 62 minutes) (all P<0.001 over 5 years). Rates of cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest, and overall in-hospital mortality increased (5.7% to 6.3%). Adjusted mortality excluding patients with known cardiac arrest decreased by 14% at 3 years and 25% at 5 years ( P<0.001). Conclusions Quality of care for patients with ST -segment-elevation myocardial infarction improved over time in Mission: Lifeline, including increased use of reperfusion therapy and faster times-to-treatment. In-hospital mortality improved for patients without cardiac arrest but did not appear to improve overall as the number of these high-risk patients increased."
30596218,NK-Cell Lymphomas.,"NK-cell malignancies are rare aggressive diseases associated with poor clinical outcome. There is a significant geographic variation in their incidence. At least a part of the reason for that is the fact that Epstein-Barr virus plays an important role in pathogenesis, and importantly, the plasma viral titer reflects disease burden and response to therapy. Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKL), is the most common disease subtype in NK-cell malignancies. Conventional anthracycline-based chemotherapy was historically used for ENKL, only to produce dismal outcome. More recently, concurrent chemoradiation therapy for early-stage disease and non-anthracycline-based L-asparaginase containing chemotherapy have been studied, showing improved clinical response and survival, with long-term survival rates of 60-70% and 50-60%, respectively. Stem cell transplant can provide long-term disease control in recurrent or refractory disease settings, but the role of frontline use of such approach is yet to be determined. Several novel therapeutic approaches have shown promising results, and enrollment to clinical trials is the essential key to improve the treatment outcome in the future."

Rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome. Management of severe hyponatremia in patients with acute or chronic kidney disease who require continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is limited by the lack of commercially available hypotonic dialysate or replacement fluid solutions.
30596166,Pink Urine Syndrome: A Combination of Insulin Resistance and Propofol.,"Pink urine syndrome is mostly seen in patients treated with propofol anesthesia. The pink color is attributed to the presence of large concentrations of uric acid (and pigment), which is excreted in large amounts when propofol is given. We describe a case of propofol-induced pink urine syndrome and perform a comprehensive, evidence-based review. We discuss prior case studies already published in the literature as we speculate on the pathophysiology and how it translates to a clinically relevant entity."
30596165,The Glomerular Disease Study and Trial Consortium: A Grassroots Initiative to Foster Collaboration and Innovation.,"Glomerular kidney disorders account for a significant proportion of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease worldwide. Nevertheless, major obstacles make breakthrough progress in diagnosis and cure an ongoing challenge. Here we report the creation of a ""grassroots"" initiative that aims to provide new opportunities for nephrologists, pathologists, basic and clinical scientists, patients, and industry partners to collaborate in the field of glomerular kidney disease. Members of the medical community, including trainees, nephrologists, and nephropathologists, can participate in the open-access, Web-based, multidisciplinary clinical video case conferences, which provide ""peer-to-peer"" exchange of clinical and pathological expertise combined with a formal didactic curriculum. Participants can also join other aspects of the broader initiative. These include the participation in a multisite research study to facilitate enrollment of patients into a longitudinal clinical data and biorepository for glomerular kidney disorders. Items included in this prospective registry include the following: an ontology-based patient medical history, which is regularly updated; interval collection and storage of blood and urine samples; DNA collection; and a contact registry for patients who wish to participate in clinical trials. Participating sites and external scientists can leverage access to the database to pursue genetic, biomarker, epidemiological, and observational clinical effectiveness studies. Patients can independently sign up for a supplementary contact registry to participate in clinical trials if eligible. The broad spectrum of activities within this initiative will foster closer collaboration among trainees, practicing nephrologists, pathologists, and researchers, and may help to overcome some of the barriers to progress in the field of glomerular kidney disease."

30596031,Solid pancreas transplant: Pushing forward.,"Pancreas transplant has evolved significantly in recent years. It has now become a viable treatment option on type 1 diabetic patients with poorly controlled diabetes on conventional treatment, insulin intolerance, hypoglycaemia unawareness, brittle diabetes and/ or end-stage kidney disease. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of pancreas transplant historical origins and current barriers to broader utilization of pancreata for transplant, with a focus on areas for future improvement to better pancreas transplant care. Donor pancreata remain underutilized; pancreatic allograft discard rates remain close to 30% in the United States. Donations after cardiac death (DCD) pancreata are seldom procured. Study groups from Europe and the United Kingdom showed that procurement professionalization and standardization of technique, as well as development of independent regional procurement teams might increase organ procurement efficiency, decrease discards and increase pancreatic allograft utilization. Pancreas transplant programs should consider exploring pancreas procurement opportunities on DCD and obese donors. Selected type 2 diabetics should be considered for pancreas transplant. Longer follow-up studies need to be performed in order to ascertain the long-term cardiovascular and quality of life benefits following pancreas transplant; the outcomes of which might eventually spearhead advocacy towards broader application of pancreas transplant among diabetics."
30596030,Circulating microRNAs as biomarkers for diabetic neuropathy: A novel approach.,"Oxidative stress stemming from tissue exposure to constant hyperglycemia is one of the major pathogenetic pathways of diabetic macro- and microvascular complications. Diabetic polyneuropathy, commonly manifesting as distal, symmetrical sensorimotor polyneuropathy, is characterized by progressive severity of symptoms, with rates analogous to the quality of glycemic control achieved by the patients and physicians. Palliative care with analgesics and aggressive glycemic control often improve quality of life in the absence of causative treatment. Currently, there is a growing body of evidence indicating the role of microRNAs in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications, with emphasis on diabetic nephropathy and neuropathy. Therefore, in this review, we aim to explore the role of microRNAs and their polymorphisms in the pathophysiology of diabetic polyneuropathy, as well as, the possibility of novel diagnostic and therapeutic applications by epigenetic profiling and manipulation."
30596016,Photoacoustic tomography for human musculoskeletal imaging and inflammatory arthritis detection.,"With the capability of assessing high resolution optical contrast in soft tissues, photoacoustic imaging (PAI) can offer valuable structural and functional information of human joints, and hold potential for diagnosis and treatment monitoring of inflammatory arthritis. Recent studies have demonstrated that PAI can map 2D and 3D morphology of the cartilage, synovium, vascularity, and bone tissue in human peripheral joints. Initial trials with patients affected by inflammatory arthritis have also suggested that PAI can detect the hemodynamic properties in articular tissues as well as their changes due to active inflammation. This review focuses on the recent progress in technical development of PAI for human musculoskeletal imaging and inflammation detection. PAI can provide non-invasive and non-ionizing serial measurements for monitoring of therapeutic interventions with the potential for higher sensitivity than existing imaging modalities such as ultrasound. However, further investigation is needed to validate the value of PAI in rheumatology clinical settings."
30596009,Primary isolated bone marrow diffuse large B cell lymphoma with long-term complete remission.,"Secondary bone marrow involvement of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is relatively common. However, primary isolated bone marrow involvement in NHL which was successfully treated and remains in complete remission (CR) for a long-term duration without any relapse is extremely rare. We herein report a patient of primary bone marrow diffuse large B cell lymphoma (PBML/DLBCL) who presented a prolonged high-grade fever and systemic purpura due to severe thrombocytopenia. The patient was successfully treated with systemic chemotherapy by R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone) and remains in CR at 8 years after the initial diagnosis.

Increasing evidence indicates that the respiratory microbiome has an important role in respiratory health and disease and is both impacted by and potentially contributes to the severity of symptomatic respiratory viral infections and asthma in children. A deeper understanding of the complex interactions between bacteria, viruses, and the host will provide further comprehension into the drivers and mechanisms of respiratory health and disease and will impart opportunities for clinical therapies."
30595950,Potassium-competitive acid blockers - are they the next generation of proton pump inhibitors?,"The modern lifestyle caters to an increase in the incidence of peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease and several other acid-related conditions of the gut. The drugs to prevent these conditions work either through H2 receptor blockade or inhibition of the H<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> ATPase enzyme. Although proton pump inhibitors have been proven to be efficacious, they have a slow onset of action with limited resolution of symptoms in most patients. Potassium-competitive acid blockers (P-CABs) are novel drugs that bind reversibly to K<sup>+</sup> ions and block the H<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> ATPase enzyme, thus preventing acid production. P-CABs have a fast onset of action and have dose-dependent effects on acid production. Animal studies exist that differentiate the better results of P-CABs from proton pump inhibitors; further human trials will give a comprehensive picture of the results and will help to elucidate the therapeutic benefits of this new group of drugs."
30595936,Urethral Polyembolokoilamania: An Unusual Manifestation of Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD).,"Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) have varied presentations and frequently occur throughout the trajectory of dementia. Hypersexuality and general disinhibition of societal and cultural norms are commonly documented in all types of dementia. However, sparse literature exists on polyembolokoilamania (insertion of foreign objects in bodily orifices) without a sexual component as a dementia-related symptom. We review an unusual case of a 94-year-old man who presented with urethral polyembolokoilamania without hypersexuality or other behavioral disinhibition. We highlight clinical considerations of managing urethral polyembolokoilamania in an elderly patient without a previous neurocognitive disorder diagnosis. A multidisciplinary team approach with input from Internal Medicine, Urology, Psychiatry, and Neurology lead to a comprehensive assessment of a patient that could have been managed solely as a surgical case. This spearheaded a formal diagnosis of neurocognitive disorder-guiding successful management, follow-up, caregiver education, and reduction of further harm."
30595922,"Hip Fracture Nonunions: Diagnosis, Treatment, and Special Considerations in Elderly Patients.","In the United States, more than 300,000 hip fractures occur annually in the elderly population with associated significant morbidity and mortality. Both intracapsular and extracapsular hip fractures have inherent treatment challenges and therefore are at risk of nonunion complications. A systematic assessment including radiographic, metabolic, and infectious evaluations should be completed for all patients suspected of nonunion. Failed internal fixation of intracapsular hip fractures is typically treated with arthroplasty, while extracapsular proximal femur nonunions may be amenable to revision internal fixation or arthroplasty. While not a classic hip fracture, bisphosphate associated subtrochanteric femur fractures affect a similar patient population and are historically difficult to treat. Atypical subtrochanteric femur fractures are at increased risk of nonunion given the altered biologic environment secondary to bisphosphonate use; therefore adjuvant therapies may be beneficial in setting of revision fixation. Having a thorough understanding of nonunion risks, recognition, evaluation, and treatment is necessary for appropriate patient care."

30595767,Endovascular therapy for subclavian artery restenosis due to stent strut protrusion with high-resolution angioscopy and three-dimensional optical frequency domain imaging.,"A 47-year-old female patient was admitted with a complaint of severe chest pain on effort. She had a history of effort angina treated using coronary artery bypass with left internal thoracic arterial bypass to the left ascending coronary artery. She also had left subclavian and vertebral arterial stenoses, which were treated with balloon-expandable stents. Exercise stress myocardial perfusion imaging revealed anterior to apex left ventricular myocardial ischemia. Cardiac ischemia due to left subclavian stenosis was diagnosed. We treated the left subclavian arterial stenosis with endovascular therapy. We observed that the vertebral Palmaz stent protruded from the ostium and the jailed subclavian artery on high-resolution angioscopy (Zemporshe with a 0.48-megapixel equivalent resolution; Taisho Biomed Instruments, Osaka, Japan) and optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI). A guide wire was successfully crossed through the Palmaz stent strut, which was confirmed using three-dimensional OFDI. The stent strut was dilated using balloon angioplasty. New imaging technologies are promising tools for improving the efficacy and safety of craniocervical intervention. <<b>Learning objective:</b> New imaging technologies including high-resolution angioscopy and 3D-optical frequency domain imaging have become available for endovascular therapy of peripheral artery disease. They could be used to observe stent strut deformation with high imaging quality and demonstrated successful guidewire passage through the stent strut. High-resolution angioscopic system yields images with higher quality and larger angular field than any other previous angioscopy systems.>."
30595757,My burning issues in neuroendocrine tumours (NET).,"Several compounds have recently been approved for the systemic treatment of advanced well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours (NET) of gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) or lung origin. Based on the PROMID and CLARINET trials, somatostatin analogues (SSA) are the preferred first-line approach for all GEP-NET and offer-in addition to antiproliferative effects-durable symptomatic relief for hormonally active tumours. The mTOR inhibitor everolimus has been approved for progressive GEP- and lung-NET and is a widely used drug in this setting. Furthermore, recent results have underlined the high efficacy of somatostatin-receptor targeting radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in somatostatin-receptor positive midgut tumours and PRRT is now considered standard treatment for midgut-NET progressing on SSA. The optimal application of PRRT in somatostatin receptor positive NET with non-midgut site is currently an issue of discussion and should be decided on an individually basis in multidisciplinary boards.

30595752,ASCO 2018 NSCLC highlights-combination therapy is key.,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment was booming at this year's ASCO 2018 meeting as several well-performed phase III trials with practice-changing potential were presented. Thereby immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) consolidated its major role in the treatment of NSCLC patients without genetic alterations and extended its use by showing impressive data on ICB combination therapies (mainly combined with chemotherapy). Furthermore the role of predictive biomarkers for ICB therapy (Programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1] expression, tumor mutational burden [TMB] testing and others) have been further developed and blood-based tests were presented with promising data revealing the potential of this minimally invasive method for treatment monitoring and guidance in the future. Nevertheless the best biomarker is still elusive and future research is ongoing and might be a multimodal approach combining different modalities. No major studies concerning new genetic alterations or innovative targets were presented and the focus in genetic driven NSCLC was the evaluation of combinational approaches (e.g. in epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] mutation positve patients, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor [TKI] plus anti-angiogenic agent or chemotherapy backbone). The presented results showed some benefit for the combinational approach; however toxicity might be an issue and further validation is necessary. Summarizing, ASCO 2018 showed that combinational approaches will be the future standard treatment in NSCLC and that biomarker identification is more heterogeneous and complex than anticipated, but presented next generation techniques may pave the way to a more personalized cancer therapy."

30595551,Natural helix 9 mutants of PPARγ differently affect its transcriptional activity.,"The nuclear receptor PPARγ is the master regulator of adipocyte differentiation, distribution, and function. In addition, PPARγ induces terminal differentiation of several epithelial cell lineages, including colon epithelia. Loss-of-function mutations in PPARG result in familial partial lipodystrophy subtype 3 (FPDL3), a rare condition characterized by aberrant adipose tissue distribution and severe metabolic complications, including diabetes. Mutations in PPARG have also been reported in sporadic colorectal cancers, but the significance of these mutations is unclear. Studying these natural PPARG mutations provides valuable insights into structure-function relationships in the PPARγ protein. We functionally characterized a novel FPLD3-associated PPARγ L451P mutation in helix 9 of the ligand binding domain (LBD).

Local and systemic therapies including stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are rapidly evolving, necessitating reassessments of outcomes for modern patient management."
30595509,"Lipodystrophies, dyslipidaemias and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.","Lipodystrophies are rare, heterogeneous, genetic or acquired, disorders characterised by varying degrees of body fat loss and associated metabolic complications, including insulin resistance, dyslipidaemias, hepatic steatosis and predisposition to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The four main types of lipodystrophy, excluding antiretroviral therapy-induced lipodystrophy in HIV-infected patients, are congenital generalised lipodystrophy (CGL), familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD), acquired generalised lipodystrophy (AGL) and acquired partial lipodystrophy (APL). This paper reviews the literature related to the prevalence of dyslipidaemias and ASCVD in patients with lipodystrophies. Patients with CGL, AGL and FPLD have increased prevalence of dyslipidaemia but those with APL do not. Patients with CGL as well as AGL present in childhood, and have severe dyslipidaemias (mainly hypertriglyceridaemia) and early onset diabetes mellitus as a consequence of extreme fat loss. However, only a few patients with CGL and AGL have been reported to develop coronary heart disease. In contrast, data from some small cohorts of FPLD patients reveal increased prevalence of ASCVD especially among women. Patients with APL have a relatively low prevalence of hypertriglyceridaemia and diabetes mellitus. Overall, patients with lipodystrophies appear to be at high risk of ASCVD due to increased prevalence of dyslipidaemia and diabetes and efforts should be made to manage these metabolic complications aggressively to prevent ASCVD."
30595497,Targeting Cancer Stemness in the Clinic: From Hype to Hope.,"Tumors are composed of non-homogeneous cell populations exhibiting varying degrees of genetic and functional heterogeneity. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are capable of sustaining tumors by manipulating genetic and non-genetic factors to metastasize, resist treatment, and maintain the tumor microenvironment. Understanding the key traits and mechanisms of CSC survival provides opportunities to improve patient outcomes via improved prognostic models and therapeutics. Here, we review the clinical significance of CSCs and results of potential CSC-targeting therapies in various cancers. We discuss barriers to translating cues from pre-clinical models into clinical applications and propose new strategies for rational design of future anti-CSC trials."
30595479,Food Intake Recruits Orosensory and Post-ingestive Dopaminergic Circuits to Affect Eating Desire in Humans.,"Pleasant taste and nutritional value guide food selection behavior. Here, orosensory features of food may be secondary to its nutritional value in underlying reinforcement, but it is unclear how the brain encodes the reward value of food. Orosensory and peripheral physiological signals may act together on dopaminergic circuits to drive food intake. We combined fMRI and a novel [11C]raclopride PET method to assess systems-level activation and dopamine release in response to palatable food intake in humans. We identified immediate orosensory and delayed post-ingestive dopamine release. Both responses recruit segregated brain regions: specialized integrative pathways and higher cognitive centers. Furthermore, we identified brain areas where dopamine release reflected the subjective desire to eat. Immediate dopamine release in these wanting-related regions was inversely correlated with, and presumably inhibited, post-ingestive release in the dorsal striatum. Our results highlight the role of brain and periphery in interacting to reinforce food intake in humans."
30595426,The prevalence of dysnatremia in the elderly patients without CKD.,Dysnatremia is one of the most commonly encountered electrolyte disorders in the emergency department (ED). Few studies have reported the prevalence of dysnatremia in elderly patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD). We investigated the prevalence of dysnatremia in elderly patients without CKD in an emergency department in Japan.

30595395,Relation of Clinical Presentation of Aortic Stenosis and Survival Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,"Although the natural history of aortic stenosis (AS) depends on the severity of symptoms, the prognostic significance of AS clinical progression in patients who underwent aortic valve replacement is less clear. Here, we studied the correlation between the severity of AS presenting symptoms and survival after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We evaluated long-term survival of a consecutive cohort of severe AS patients (n = 862, mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons score 4.16 ± 2.9) who underwent transfemoral TAVI from 2009 to 2016. Patients were classified as having severe symptoms (i.e., angina, syncope, or heart failure, n = 424) or mild symptoms (i.e., dizziness, fatigue, effort dyspnea, chest discomfort, n = 438). No differences in device success nor in-hospital complications were found between groups. During a median follow-up of 2.84 (1.9 to 4.5) years, survival at 1, 3, and 5 years in the entire cohort, was 89% ± 1.1%, 75% ± 1.6%, and 59% ± 2.1%, respectively. Severe symptoms were associated with higher mortality (hazard ratio 1.54, 95% confidence intervals 1.230 to 1.939, p <0.001). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival was 94% ± 1.9%, 81% ± 3.3%, and 71% ± 4.3% in patients with angina, 92% ± 3.3%, 75% ± 5.6%, and 56% ± 8.2% in patients with syncope and 77% ± 3%, 54% ± 3.7%, and 41% ± 4.1% in patients with heart failure, respectively, (p <0.001). Heart failure symptoms emerged as independent predictor of mortality (hazard ratio 1.66, 1.28 to 2.17, p <0.001), regardless of left ventricular ejection fraction. The severity of AS symptoms affects survival after TAVI and overt heart failure independently predicts early mortality. Early intervention after diagnosis of severe AS is crucial to reduce the unfavorable effects of clinical progression on survival after TAVI."

30595393,Usefulness of Malignancy as a Predictor of WorseIn-Hospital Outcomes in Patients With Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.,"Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) is a form of dilated cardiomyopathy often associated with physical or emotional stress. Association with cancer has been reported, however, in-hospital outcomes in TC patients with history of malignancy have not been fully characterized. We conducted a retrospective chart review of hospitalized patients with diagnosis of TC between January 2006 and January 2017. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on the previous history of malignancy. Presenting symptoms, cardiac imaging and short-term events including in-hospital complications and mortality, were compared. Of 318 patients with TC, 81 (25.4%) had a previous diagnosis of cancer. Mean age was 67.5 (SD 12.6), 151 (47.5%) were African American, 122 (38.4%) Caucasian, and 10 (3.1%) of other ethnicities. Patients with history of malignancy were older (70.0 [SD 10.6] vs 66.6 [SD 13.1] years, p = 0.03), had higher heart rate on presentation (93 [SD 19] vs 87 [SD 25] beats/minute, p = 0.03), higher prevalence of severely decreased cardiac function (left ventricular ejection fraction <25%) (29.6% vs 16%, p = 0.01), longer hospitalization (7 (4-13) vs 4 (3-8) days, p = 0.001) and experienced more in-hospital cardiac arrests (6 [7.4%] vs 5 [2.1%], p = 0.035) compared with patients without malignancy history. Higher percentage of longer hospitalization and left ventricular ejection fraction <25% in the cancer group persisted after controlling for sepsis, chemotherapy exposure, and metastatic disease. In conclusion, in a racially diverse hospitalized population of TC, prevalence of cancer history is high, and diagnosis of previous malignancy is associated with adverse in-hospital outcomes."
