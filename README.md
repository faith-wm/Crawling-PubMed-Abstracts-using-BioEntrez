*How to extract articles and their abstracts from PubMed database*

Here I share the code for getting PubMed articles.
Mainly I am interested in the PubMed ID (pmid), title and abstract.
The code can be slightly modified to fetch more information such as author names and affiliations among other information depending on your needs.

I mainly use the BioEntrex python library.
More details on the usage of the library can be found at: https://biopython.org/DIST/docs/api/Bio.Entrez-module.html#esearch


*Applications*

PubMed is a public database and is a rich source of information.
Researchers who have limited access to real clinical information due to privacy isssues can freely use PubMed articles to develop clinical applications.
